## about.txt

17, Izmir, student by day, code breaker by night. saturn resident with questionable life choices and a passion for overengineering simple problems. probably procrastinating on assignments while building random web apps.

## stuff i break regularly

- web apps that probably shouldn't exist
- linux configs until 3am
- my sleep schedule

## tech stack (when i remember to use it)

`arch linux` `hyprland` `kitty` `javascript` `html/css` `random scripts`

## current mission

🚲 building things nobody asked for but i find interesting  
🌐 making the web a slightly weirder place  
💻 arch btw
